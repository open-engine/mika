     * three syntaxes.
     *
     * Normally, the empty path "" and absolute path "/" are considered equal as
     * defined in RFC 7230 Section 2.7.3. But this method MUST NOT automatically
     * do this normalization because in contexts with a trimmed base path, e.g.
     * the front controller, this difference becomes significant. It's the task
     * of the user to handle both "" and "/".
     *
     * The value returned MUST be percent-encoded, but MUST NOT double-encode
     * any characters. To determine what characters to encode, please refer to
     * RFC 3986, Sections 2 and 3.3.
     *
     * As an example, if the value should include a slash ("/") not intended as
     * delimiter between path segments, that value MUST be passed in encoded
     * form (e.g., "%2F") to the instance.
